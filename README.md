## FAQ

### Can I use this with my existing Medusa store?

Absolutely! Medusa POS is designed to work with any standard Medusa v2 store without backend modifications. Just connect via the Admin API.

### What is the minimum Medusa version required?

Medusa POS requires Medusa v2. It integrates directly with the Medusa Admin REST API, so ensure your backend is running Medusa v2 or later.

### Why can't I use an HTTP Medusa URL?

For security reasons, Medusa POS requires a secure HTTPS connection to your Medusa backend. HTTP connections are not supported to ensure data protection and compliance with modern security standards.

### How is payment handled?

Medusa POS currently focuses on order management without integrated payment processing in the MVP. We're developing a payment screen that will support cash payments using Medusa's manual payment plugin. Additionally, we're working on plugins and integrations with Stripe and Adyen payment terminals for seamless POS transactions.

### Is offline mode supported?

Full offline mode is not supported in the current version. The app requires a network connection to create new orders or sync data. However, we cache Medusa responses locally, allowing you to browse previously loaded products and orders even without an internet connection.

### How do I distribute the app?

We'll soon publish Medusa POS to the App Store and Google Play Store for easy access. If you have special distribution needs or require a customized app, Agilo offers professional services to help. We've already deployed several POS apps in production. Reach out to us for tailored solutions.

### Can I customize the app?

Yes, you're free to fork the repository and make your own customizations. Additionally, Agilo provides professional customization services for Medusa POS, including UI/UX adjustments, integrations with hardware (like barcode scanners or printers), and connections to other systems (ERPs, inventory management, etc.). For specific customizations, contact us at [Agilo](https://www.agilo.com/contact/) to discuss your needs.

### What PRs will be merged?

We welcome contributions that benefit the general use of Medusa POS, such as bug fixes, performance improvements, or new features applicable to most users. Pull requests for specific customizations or client-specific changes will not be merged to keep the core codebase maintainable.

### How do I report bugs or request features?

Open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Agilo/medusa-pos-starter/issues) with details about the bug or feature request. For urgent matters, contact us directly.
